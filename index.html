        <div class="introduction">
            <p>I suppose if you really had to choose a quote to describe me, it would be that one. My entire 
                existence is based around the idea of uncovering the dark and repressed side 
                that every person harbors within them. If you want to truly see what a person is like without
                all the filters and masks, you can do one of two things. Put them at their worst, or put them at
                their best.
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Sorry, my name is Brandon, and this is my portfolio. It'll be a tiny window into my soul,
            into my thoughts, and into the type of person I am at my core. But don't get lost, for the mind 
            can be a maelstrom of thoughts that never really subside fully.
            </p><br><hr><br>
            <p>My interests are quite simple, really. Writing novels is perhaps my number one hobby, but I also am known
            to write short stories and poetry whenever the occasion strikes me. Following closely behind that is playing video games, and reading books. 
            It's not much or very exciting, but it is what it is.

            <p>This is a video game that up until recently I played actively, called League of Legends. 
            Below is one of the newest promotional wallpapers, featuring five playable characters or "champions."</p>

            <br><br><p>This is one of my favorite books and one that's gone on to become a movie in recent times, "Ready Player One" by Ernest Cline. Seen here is the book cover
                of the initial release.

            <br><br><p>I don't have any actual book covers or sketches to speak of in terms of my novelized works, so this is a 
            stand-in image of what my ideal workspace would look like. Minimalism is usually what I go for.

            <br><br><p>Finally, I thought I'd put in a little bit about my taste in music. Most of them, I'll listen to anything that matches
                the mood I'm in, which is why I have over twenty playlists of different genres of music. This is the album cover of
                one of my favorite albums, "Save Rock and Roll" by Fall Out Boy.
